# Recipe-Finder
This project uses Spoonacular API to organize and display recipe data based on the user's needs.

API information:
Spoonacular API was used to acquire the information related to all recipes.


Code Functionality:
The user enters his/her limits on the maximum amount of carbs, cholesterol, and sugar that they are willing to put into their recipe. A list of relevant 
food recipes are displayed to the user. The code allows the user to select a recipe by it's corresponding index, and the selected recipe's required ingredients are displayed to the user. It is formatted so that the name of each ingredient is displayed, followed by the amount that is needed. Finally, the user can view similar recipes to the one that was originally selected.
